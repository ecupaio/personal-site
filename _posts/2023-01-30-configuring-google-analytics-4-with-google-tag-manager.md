Google Analytics 4 is here and Universal Analytics is [set to end on July 1, 2023](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528)&nbsp;so let's take advantage of the update and set up Google Tag Manager. In this guide, I will cover how to set up a Google Analtytics 4 property&nbsp;

## About Google Analytics 4

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest iteration of Google Analytics. A lot has changed in how events get tracked and how to view your site's data. GA4 added some automatic tracking for page scrolling, file downloads, and clicks. You will still need to configure custom events, but they added some recommended events with parameters specific to the event instead of the old system that was limited to action, category, and label. If you're not enthralled by these new features or don't know what in the heck I'm talking about, that's okay. Google Analytics 4 will be the only way for you to track analytics on your website (via Google for free) so like it or not you need to set it up on your site.&nbsp;

## About Google Tag Manager

If you don't already know, Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a great way to configure your analytics and events, add tracking pixels and other code to the head of your site, and take advantage of Google Suite products like Ads.&nbsp;
