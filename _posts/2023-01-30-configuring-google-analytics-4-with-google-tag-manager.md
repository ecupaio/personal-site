Google Analytics 4 is here and Universal Analytics is [set to end on July 1, 2023](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528)&nbsp;so let's take advantage of the update and set up Google Tag Manager. In this guide, I will cover how to set up a Google Analytics 4 property. You can skip to the instructions if you don't want to read all about the new changes.&nbsp; &nbsp;

## About Google Analytics 4

Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is the latest iteration of Google Analytics. A lot has changed in how events get tracked and how to view your site's data. GA4 added some automatic tracking for page scrolling, file downloads, and clicks. You will still need to configure custom events, but they added some recommended events with parameters specific to the event instead of the old system that was limited to action, category, and label. If you're not enthralled by these new features or don't know what in the heck I'm talking about, that's okay. Google Analytics 4 will be the only way for you to track analytics on your website (via Google for free) so like it or not you need to set it up on your site.&nbsp;

## About Google Tag Manager

If you don't already know, Google Tag Manager (GTM) is a great way to configure your analytics and events, add tracking pixels and other code to the head of your site, and take advantage of Google Suite products like Ads or Search Console. Google Tag Manager makes it so that you don't ever have to touch your site's code again, after installation of course. You can trigger events based on link text and drop in tracking pixel code with ease. Plus it's what all us elite, level 9000 javascript-fu masters use so more than likely the integrations you need will play nice with GTM and have docs to support it.&nbsp;
