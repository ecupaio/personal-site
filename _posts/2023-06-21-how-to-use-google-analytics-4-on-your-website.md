As of writing this post, the Universal Analytics sunset is still looming with a scheduled end date of July 1. I've set up quite a few clients on GA4 and I noticed a common trend: They all had analytics but either didn't know what was being tracked and if they knew they didn't know how to use that data. If you fall into either of those camps, I'm here to help. I will walk you through how to relate interactions on your website to your goals as a business.&nbsp;

## Determine your Business Objectives

A lot of people skip this first step and want to get down to seeing how many people clicked their facebook share icon without considering first, how does that data inform their goals. For every event tracked on a website, ask yourself "What would I change about my site knowing this data?" &nbsp;If you don't know the answer to that question it's because you're tracking events with no connection to your business objectives. A business objective can be anything from acquiring 100 leads to recording $100,000 in sales. The import aspect of your business objective is that it is quantifiable in that you have a goal number in mind. Don't think about your website in this step, we'll get to that next. Just think about what you want to achieve with your business or organization and attach a number to the goal if you haven't already. You might have already existing KPIs (Key Progress Indicators), those work perfectly for using Google Analytics 4 to make data-driven decisions.

## Find/Create Events that Support your Business Objectives

Now that you have your business objectives ready, take a look at your website and determine where users can help you achieve those objectives. A simple example would be if you had a revenue goal for t-shirt sales on your website. The interaction of a user completing a purchase of a t-shirt would&nbsp;

You might not find a method for users to achieve some of your objectives since it's not possible for a user to sign a contract or show up to an event on your website, but there are actions they can take to schedule an introductory meeting with you or RSVP for that event.&nbsp;
