      Is your site slow? Can you load it on mobile? Just making your website load fast and usable on mobile can improve your conversions without changing a single line of copy or adding any features.

      Is your meta configured? Do you have Search Console integrated into Analytics? Are you headings in proper descending order? Do even know what I'm talking about? I've been developing websites for a long time so I know every single item your website needs to be visible to search engines before we get into using query data to boost your page rankings.

      Having a secure and accessible site can positively impact your SEO as well as your conversions so let's take a look under the hood to make sure everything is compliant.
