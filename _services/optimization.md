      It should be obvious what users should do when they see your website within 1 second. If it's not, let's fix that. I'll help you make your calls to action obvious in order to convert users into customers.

  - title: A/B Testing
    text: |-
      Ever wonder if adding a new feature or just changing the text on a button will improve your conversions? I do all the time, that's why I love running experiments. With my services you get to test your assumptions with scientific certainty.

  - title: Research and Analytics
    text: |- 
      Most websites I work on have Google Analytics installed but very few site owners know what it all means. Let me make sense of all the numbers and help you track interactions on your site as they relate to your organization goals.

  - title: Performance Boost
    text: |-
      Is your site slow? Can you load it on mobile? Just making your website load fast and usable on mobile can improve your conversions without changing a single line of copy or adding any features.

    text: |-  
      Is your meta configured? Do you have Search Console integrated into Analytics? Are you headings in proper descending order? Do even know what I'm talking about? I've been developing websites for a long time so I know every single item your website needs to be visible to search engines before we get into using query data to boost your page rankings.

  - title: Security and Accessibility 
    text: |-  
      Having a secure and accessible site can positively impact your SEO as well as your conversions so let's take a look under the hood to make sure everything is compliant. Adding a SSL certificate for free and adjusting color contrasts are just a few of the quick tricks up my sleeve to ensure your website is safe and usable by everyone.

  title: How it works
  items: 
  - title: Setting goals for your website
    text: What are the goals of your organization? How can your website help you achieve those goals? Let's answer those questions and set up tracking for the desired user behavior on your site.  
  - title: Finding areas for improvement 
    text: With goals configured and tracked, we can now see how your content and features perform. I'll use my years of experience to show you ways to make the most out of your site.
  - title: Implementing solutions
    text: I don't put post-its on a wall. I can actually practice what I preach. I'll fix any errors first, then we can run A/B tests so we can have empirical data on whether or not the changes will work.  
  - title: Analyzing the data
    text: As part of the [engineering design process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_design_process), we'll go through the numbers and determine next steps based on what the data says, not what I feel needs to be done. Numbers don't lie and neither do I. Let's be honest with ourselves and do it right.
