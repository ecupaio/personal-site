  SacConnects was previously designed and built by another agency, but it had
  two problems: it fell out of updates from wordpress and got hacked and the
  business owner, Nancy, was unable to easily update their content. I put the
  site on my Jekyll template, redesigned the homepage for better UX, and added a
  bespoke CMS that allowed Nancy to make updates all on her own.
