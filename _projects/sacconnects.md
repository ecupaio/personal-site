  SacConnects was previously designed and built by another agency, but it had
  two problems: it fell out of updates from wordpress and got hacked and the
  business owner, Nancy, was unable to easily update their content. I put the
  site on my Jekyll template, redesigned the homepage and nav bar for better UX,
  and added a bespoke CMS that allowed Nancy to make updates all on her own.

The [old homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190112080425/https://www.sacconnects.net/) for this site had accessibility issues and Nancy could not easily update it. Plus the layout served way too much information in the view port so I slotted the content feeds into easily readable blocks. All of the content you see on the homepage and the rest of the site is controlled by Nancy. For example, the reviews on the homepage are pulled from the Client content type. She just marks the client as featured and, voila - it's on the home page for everyone to see. Also the client logos are automatically fed into the clients section.&nbsp;

The design is basic, but basic can be good! It's accessible and loads lightening fast. I gave Nancy, just like all my clients and stakeholders, a full analytics upgrade with Search Console added so she can see exactly how people are finding her and using her website.&nbsp; &nbsp;
