Fun fact: I got married at Republic Restoratives Distillery (I have a large Irish-Catholic family) and my good friends established it; so when they asked if I could build them a website I jumped on it. They said don't mix friends and business, but they were a perfect cocktail of flexible and goal oriented. Before we came along, they had a broken wordpress site that was not functional and expensive to host. I created a lightning fast Jekyll site with a CMS that allowed them to keep every aspect of the site up to date with ease. I worked with our designer at eStreet.co to create a functional, minimalist, yet sleek and beautiful website. It's one of my favorite websites and I hope you like it too.
