Vote VA is an event signup page made in similarly to [Resist Summer](http://edcupaioli.com/project/resistance-summer/) in that it fetches events entered into Blue State Digital and puts them into an interactive map, which allows users to search for and RSVP to official Democratic Party of Virginia campaign events.
