description: 'Government site built on Wordpress and the CA State Web Template.  '
---
This was a labor of love since government sites have so much content to organize and keep updated. It was a perfect use case for relational content and I was able to execute it perfectly under the tutelage of [Ben Loeffler](https://ben.direct/).

Ben gave me the requirements of building a Wordpress site on [Timber](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/), use [ACF](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) for the fields and post types, and implement [Fuze.js](https://www.fusejs.io/) for the post filters. I went into a code hole for 6 months and emerged with this great new site for the CA Department of Pesticide Regulation.

What makes this site extra special is how I implemented the [CA State Web Template’s component system](https://template.webstandards.ca.gov/components.html) with ACF, Timber, and Wordpress’ much under-used Guterburg editor so that content editors can simply build pages without entering a single-line of code. That’s right: No code was involved in making [this page](https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/continuing-education/). Even the handy anchor menu is automatically generated by the headings on the page.

Much to the wonderment of HR managers that require years of experience beyond the existence of frameworks, I was able to accomplish this without any prior knowledge or experience. I solution engineered, [documented](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/guides/gutenberg/), and implemented a new way to make it happen!

The other neat aspect of this site are the resource filters that are placed throughout the site. Each resource filter allows users to search and filter through hundreds of posts to find the exact item they need instead of using site search fruitlessly. They are also a part of the aforementioned component system that content editors can drop into pages. Take a gander at some examples:

* [Look Up Pesticide Info](https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/look-up-pesticide-info/)
* [Events](https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/meetings-and-events/)
* [News and Announcements](https://www.cdpr.ca.gov/news-and-announcements/)
