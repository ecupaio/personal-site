## Description

Call your Republican senator on congress person with makecalls.democrats.org. Choose a campaign, enter your email and zip, and get connected with your federal level GOP reps.

I used [Google's Civic API](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/) to generate a list of federal representatives based on user zip code entry. I added the email input field so that I could export user data to our CRM, Blue State Digital, so that we could follow up with users for other calls to action. I created this site with Jekyll so that content editors could go in and create the call scripts for users to speak to their GOP representatives.
