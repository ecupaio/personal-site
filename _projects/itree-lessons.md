## Description
I used Drupal's Bootstrap framework in order to create this website. Lesson plans are integrated with Google Drive so that the maintainers will only have to upload a lesson once. Edits can be made to the lessons without requiring the site maintainer to upload a new lesson plan. Hosting the plans on Google Drive also alleviates the server from handling the bandwidth load of users downloading the lessons.

This site provided a friendlier and sleeker interface for users to search for and download the lessons. Lessons can be filtered by specific Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and is legacy proofed for all grade levels, not just the middle school lessons I created.

iTreeLessons.com is also host to information about i-Tree and NGSS as well as the Environmental Enrichment Fellowship, a program for teachers to pilot the lesson plans in their classrooms.
