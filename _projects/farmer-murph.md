  Although I love creating great web experiences, Farmer Murph has the best job in the world: Gardening and spreading his hobby all over California like a west coast Johnny Appleseed. The mission here was fairly straightforward: Create a website for Farmer Murph to sell his wares. I used my Jekyll template and integrated it with SnipCart's e-commerce tool that allowed him to easily manage content. Everything you see on the site can be edited by Farmer Murph in case he needs to transplant or propagate.
