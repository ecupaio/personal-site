Earth Day was a page for mostly Arcadia Power customers to see how their renewable energy plans with us compared with the rest of their state and the US. Users would enter their zip code and select which wind energy plan they are subscribed to, if at all. For non-customers, users would see how Arcadia Power customers have the option to have 100% renewable energy and we prompted with a signup button. 

Social share buttons allow users to share the site with pre-written posts and a link to the site.
