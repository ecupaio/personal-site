## Description
I can easily define my time at the DNC with the Polling Place Locator. It was a legacy project handed down to me on day one and it continues to be my favorite project I constanty tinker with and learn from. This project included a [standalone website](http://pollingplaces.democrats.org/) and an [embeddable widget](http://pollingplaces.democrats.org/localwidget.html) for state parties to use. Simply put, users entered an address and got directions to their polling place and a list of Democrats running for office.

##  Features
Although there are no elections happening right now, you can use one of the main street addresses listed below for a full look into the Polling Place Locator:
* 1 Main St (for basic layout)
* 5 Main St (for early vote locations)
* 9 Main St (for ballot list)

You can also check out the [embeddable widget](http://pollingplaces.democrats.org/localwidget.html). It's an iframe that will take the shape of any container and was designed as a more compact alternative to the main site. It will also work with the addresses I listed above
