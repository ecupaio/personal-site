  Homepage for a royalty-free music service created in hubspot  complete with
  reusable and editable content modules and sections.

I put my Hubspot CMS certification to good use on this homepage. Every single line of text, button, link, image, placeholder text in the search form, and even the padding and color of the page sections is editable. Not only did I build this gorgeous homepage, design courtesy of James Vanderplant of Alchemy Collective, I also created a theme complete with reusable modules and standardized styles.

This was such a great project to work on since my client, Soundstripe, provided all the legwork on project management so all I had to do was solution and code. I won't divulge the amount but it was done on the cheap because they came ready and provided me everything I needed to be successful.
