  SCOTUS Confirmation is comprised of three microsites: [Obstruct Chuck](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726183614/http://obstructchuck.com/), [Do Your Job Pat](https://web.archive.org/web/20211025001230/https://doyourjobpat.com/), and [Do Your Job Richard Burr](https://web.archive.org/web/20190801044837/http://doyourjobrichardburr.com/). I built all three sites with my rapid response template as frontends for CRM signup forms for state party engagement lists. I created a lazy load for youtube iframe on [Obstruct Chuck](https://web.archive.org/web/20160726183614/http://obstructchuck.com/) that allows for faster page load.
