  As a member of the league, I had to use their crappy old wordpress site and I was thrilled when they put out a RFP for their new site. I built this on my speed and search engine optimized Jekyll template and gave them a custom CMS to manage both on and off field communications. Every single line of text and image is fully editable and they will never have to worry about plugin updates or security so they can focus on their mission instead of bugs. [Read more](/study/dcgffl/) about my approach to the design and user flows.
