I created this site for my friend's consulting business. I wanted to build a Wordpress template complete from scratch and without the help of any plugins (with the exception of the custom fields plugin which allows users to edit custom fields I added). With the exception of the order of content, everything is customizable by the admin user.  From the meta text to the slider, everything has an editable field for my admin to change to his delight.Not that most would notice, but I used the Google Static Maps API to generate a background image map of Umbrella Consulting's address so if their address changes, so will the map!
