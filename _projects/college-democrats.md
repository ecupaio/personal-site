## Description
Collegedems.com  is the official site for College Democrats. This started as a static microsite and later converted into a Jekyll site so that content editors could updated the bios page .
## Features
[Twitter Timeline](http://)  
I used [Twitter Post Fetcher](https://github.com/jasonmayes/Twitter-Post-Fetcher)  and [Slick Carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) to make a custom branded twitter timeline. It's fully interactive and mobile ready.

[Chapters Map](https://collegedems.com/chapters.html)  
The chapters map was built with [Google Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232) and [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) so that chapters can be easily updated each year by pasting a spreadsheet created by College Democrats into the Fusion Table.

[State Federation List ](https://collegedems.com/chapters.html)
The State Federation list is a filterable list built with [Miso Dataset](http://misoproject.com/dataset/) so that College Democrats can simply paste their compiled info into a Google Drive spreadsheet.
