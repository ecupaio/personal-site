## Description
I can define my time at the DNC with the Polling Place Locator. It was a legacy project handed down to me on day one and it was my favorite project that I constanly tinkered with and learned from. This project included a [standalone website](http://pollingplaces-stage.democrats.org/) and an [embeddable widget](http://pollingplaces-stage.democrats.org/localwidget.html) for state parties to use. Simply put, users entered an address and got directions to their polling place and a list of Democrats running for office. Users could then email or print directions to their polling places and access voting guidelines in their respective states.
