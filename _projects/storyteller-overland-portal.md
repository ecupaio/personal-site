  Storyteller Overland needed a user portal for their owners and dealers, but
  all they had was a bulleted list of actions users could take and a partially
  completed design. No problem for me as I wear many hats. I build this portal
  with Gatsby to act as a frontend for Netsuite and used Netlify Identity to
  connect users to their data without giving them Netsuite access. I worked with
  a great designer and a team of backend engineers to get this massive, but
  rewarding job done.

You won't be able to get past the login or signup screens, but trust me when I say there's tons of functionality packed into this frontend. The initial challenge was to find a way to connect people in the Netsuite database without given them a seat in Netsuite which would expose internal company details. I worked with some really great Netsuite backend engineers to devise a system where we could connect an email with a record and create an auth account with a third-party integration, Netlify Identity, that would handle logging in and signing up. Once we figured that out, it was off to the races. Now owners and dealers of Storyteller Overland vans are able to reach out to support, respond to open cases, register warranties, and transfer their vans. Previously they could&nbsp; only submit cases and register warranties through a buggy hubspot form that would occasionally malform data.&nbsp;

This was a really great project to work on since I got to wear my product manager hat and control everything from the nav bar design down to how records were related in Netsuite. I'm really proud of what I built here so take a gander at the screens to get a mere taste of the extensive functionality I packed into this user portal.&nbsp;
