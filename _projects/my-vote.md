My Vote is a custom page I created on [Democrats.org](project/democratsorg). It allows users to create custom images that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter. The page serves as a frontend for a custom image generator,Tanto, which was created by my brilliant colleague Sophia Peaslee. I simply created the buttons and made sure the endpoints connected. Each image generated also creates a website so that Facebook and Twitter can display the custom image from the meta text when users shared it to their channels.
