When I started working at Arcadia Power, they had a website that looked great but wasn't optimized and lacked a lot functionality. I completely refactored their website and shaved a significant amount of load time which improved new account conversions. Along with the tuneup, I added a multitude of pages that helped my marketing team achieve it's goals.
