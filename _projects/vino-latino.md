  This was another low performing website I fixed while working at eStreet.co. I worked with designers and integrated Snipcart to deliver a seamless and optimized experience to online wine shoppers. I also ran several successful experiments that significantly increased Add to Cart and Purchase actions. We were also able to list products in Google shopping results with my implementation of Google Merchant Center.
