about: |-
  I make websites and I make sure they're effective. I can design the layout, code the site, and optimize it through A/B testing. Currently, I am the Web Developer for [Arcadia](https://www.arcadia.com/), where I'm attempting to build the perfect signup page.

  I'm based out of Washington, DC with my two lovable mutts and my brilliant partner, [Jess Sanders](https://jessicasandersphd.com/). I enjoy working for progressive causes and I'm a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) evangelist.
