  title: "How it works"
  items:
  - title: Supply your brand assets
    text: Give me your campaign logo, colors, and any other assets (fonts, icons, etc), then I will upload them to the site and ensure they load properly and pass WCAG compliance. 
    
  - title: Customize your layout
    text: Select your homepage layout from a variety of modular elements that can be placed in any order or combination.
    
  - title: Add in your content
    text: Everything in your site will be editable and I will provide you with step-by-step guidance to help you with content entry.
    
  - title: Launch your website
    text: Either supply me with a domain already bought or I can purchase one for you. Then I'll make it live using my best in class host and proxy service for an extra layer of security.

  title: Features
  list: 
  - title: 100% editable
    text: I've built a completely custom content management system (CMS) with [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/). Every word and image on the site is editable down the links in the footer.
  - title: Performance, Security, and Compliance  
    text: Fast load times, safe browsing, and WCAG compliant design all point to better SEO and user experience. 
  - title: Maintenance free
    text: Wordpress sites require constant core security updates and can cause plugins to break. This template is based on Jekyll, which deploys a static site that is unhackable and never requires updates. 
    
  - title: Ready for launch
    text: I've thought of every possible thing a candidate would need from my years of experience working in politics so that you can focus on the content rather than the design or features. We can be ready for launch in as little as 1 week! 
    
  - title: NGP VAN and ActBlue integrated
    text: It's what most democrat candidates use so why not have it ready to go? All you need to do is drop in your form IDs and you'll be ready for donors and volunteers visiting your site.
    
  - title: Customizations available
    text: I've made variants of each of the sections on the homepage, plus I can change the site-wide colors with just two lines of code. Everything on the template is modular and I can make it your way with relative ease. 
    
  - title: Cheap, reliable hosting
    text: $5 a month for hosting from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/customers/), an industry leading hosting provider with the best in class security and performance.
