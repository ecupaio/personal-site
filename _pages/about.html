  title: About me
  text: |-
    I am a one-person web department with 8 years experience embedded with marketing, digital, and communications teams. From enterprise websites to landing pages, I have coded and optimized them all with a user-first approach driven by data. Typically the roles of developer, UX specialist, and product manager are separate, but you get all three with me. Ideal projects and roles for me will focus on A/B testing, conversion tracking, and product management.
