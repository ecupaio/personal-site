* Increased Obama supporter turnout by 248 votes in my polling precincts through the creation and management of neighborhood volunteer teams.
* Built a grassroots organization of volunteer leaders to establish canvasses, phone banks, register voters, and enter data in order to increase overall turnout.
* Created a custom spreadsheet that tracked and reported real-time metrics on volunteer turnout and voter contact to regional offices.
* Optimized voter data with NGP-VAN to target prospective volunteers and found solutions for any of the technology needs/issues at the field office.
