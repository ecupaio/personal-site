I wrote these instructions assuming you have NameCheap. Other domain services will allow you to modify the settings, but definitely go with CloudFlare for your SSL certificate since it's free and they have a great UI and support. 

Create an account with CloudFlare

Add CNAME and A records

Add custom DNS to NameCheap
