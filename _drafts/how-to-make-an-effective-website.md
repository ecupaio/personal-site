Although I [warn against DIY](https://edcupaioli.com/blog/di-why-5-reasons-to-get-a-custom-website-for-your-business/), some of y'all don't have a spare 10 to 20 grand to drop on a shiny new website so I've written this guide to help you in your journey into amateur web design and development.

## Start with an objective

When I go to your website as a user, what should I be able to do? Before you start playing around with [background videos and other pointless animations](https://edcupaioli.com/blog/8-ux-trends-that-need-to-go/), take out a sheet of paper and write down "USERS WILL BE ABLE TO..." at the top. Then think about how users are your site will become customers. What do they need to do to patron your business? Will they need to make a reservation? Will they need to arrive at your physical location to pick up an order? These are the important questions you need to answer and turn into objectives to your site. For example, users on my site will be able to set a meeting with me to discuss their project so I have an easily accessible signup form they can toggle open with a button. From there I get their contact information and they set an appointment in one fell swoop. Then, hopefully, I acquire them as a client. I didn't start with "oh I need to build this animated form that asks them one question at a time", which honestly I did have until I thought hard about the objective I set for users. I started with, people need to meet with me in order to discuss their potential project, so user will be able to set up an appointment with me in the quickest possible manner.

## ABC: Always Be Converting

_Alec Baldwin voice:_ PUT THAT COFFEE DOWN...coffee is for converters.

Now that you have your objectives for users visiting your site, let's see which of them are conversions. Conversions are when you turn a user into a customer. For example, when someone schedules a meeting with me, that's a conversion. They saw my site and we're impressed with my portfolio, so they scheduled a meeting with me. I actually log that conversion into Google Analytics and now I can see which pages are most effective at helping me convert users. Since this is the primary objective of my site and my only conversion, I make it available in every section. It's at the bottom of this post! Always make sure your users can convert at a point of interest. If you are describing your services, then allow the user to take action upon reading how wonderful your business is. 

## One thing at a time

Now you have your objectives for your site and you know which ones will directly help your business grow, you can start on your layout.
