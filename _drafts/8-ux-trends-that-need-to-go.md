I'm a bit of a rare breed in that I really care about the performance on a site after I build it. It's the whole reason I got into coding: I want to create user-friendly experiences that help organizations achieve their goals. Your conversion rate is the only stat that matters, not if someone thinks your website design really pops. So when stakeholders ask me to do things that get in the way of people converting I typically show them lots of data and studies while their eyes glaze over. Their retort is "I think people would like it.", when the data says otherwise so here's a click-bait article that I kept short and sweet to avoid these pitfalls.

## Opening Links in New Tabs

Imagine you go to a website for a restaurant. While you're perusing the menu, you see a link to a review by your local paper. You click on it because you want to read this review about the restaurant you're considering dining at. You have decided that the content that you are currently viewing is no longer relevant to your interests and you have found something else you want to view. Do you see what I'm saying here? 

### Your Back Button is Rendered Inoperable

You might think, "Oh but how will people get back to my site?" That big ol' left arrow next to the address bar (or left carat on the bottom of the screen for mobile) tends to do a great job at that, but you've rendered it unusable because you wanted to open a link in a new tab. Plus, how many tabs do you have open now? Good luck trying to find the site you were originally on either on desktop, or worse, on mobile.
