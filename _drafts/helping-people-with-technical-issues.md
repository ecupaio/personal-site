A little coding humor folks: 

    var forest = document.querySelectors('.tree');

See the forest for the trees, get it? It's a [running joke](https://i.redd.it/av1g54jp94i71.png) that stackoverflow, a tech help forum, is filled with awful toxic little babies, but I think we can do better. Now that people, including me, are learning code from a non-technical background, there's a lot of lingo and unwritten rules people just don't know about. The solution shouldn't be to shun them but help them along in their journey. If you're a level 99 python wizard, then please read this guide from me, an average human learning something new everyday. 

## Get the big picture

Ask the person what their objective is. They might be in the weeds trying to figure out flexbox but just ask them "what's the end goal" if it isn't in their initial query. If they're trying to center a div then you have the expertise to help them. Don't be patronizing and ask "why would you do that?". I went to middle school with the most diabolical lunch table roasters. I will detail very unsavory things if you ask me that, but normal, well-adjusted people will just feel intimidated. 

## Accept nuance in jargon: You are a human, not a javascript function

Just because someone said API and what you're working with is actually GraphQL shouldn't be a hurdle. They just want to sound nerdy like you and be a part of the scrum or agile or whatever acronymic framework you use for being organized and accountable. Just nod and smile and focus on the big picture as I mentioned in my last section. The alternative solution is just to not use tech jargon with stakeholders. Just say you're doing your thing and they'll accept it. True story: my old co-worker, who is a very accomplished and talented software developer, calls CSS transitions wooshy-woos and I still do it to this day. It's fun and keeps things light. 

## One concept at a time: gradual release of responsibility is key to learning

I used to teach first grade math. When a six year-old does not know what you are talking about they will disengage and become unstimulated. When a six year-old becomes unstimulated they will find something to stimulated themselves with and you will not like it.
