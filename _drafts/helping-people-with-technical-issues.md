A little coding humor folks: 

    var forest = document.querySelectors('.tree');

See the forest for the trees, get it? It's a [running joke](https://i.redd.it/av1g54jp94i71.png) that stackoverflow, a tech help forum, is filled with awful toxic little babies, but I think we can do better. Now that people, including me, are learning code from a non-technical background, there's a lot of lingo and unwritten rules people just don't know about. The solution shouldn't be to shun them but help them along in their journey. If you're a level 99 python wizard, then please read this guide from me, an average human learning something new everyday. 

## Get the big picture

Ask the person what their objective is. They might be in the weeds trying to figure out flexbox but just ask them "what's the end goal" if it isn't in their initial query. If they're trying to center a div then you have the expertise to help them. Don't be patronizing and ask "why would you do that?". I went to middle school with the most diabolical lunch table roasters. I will detail very unsavory things if you ask me that, but normal, well-adjusted people will just feel intimidated. 

## Accept nuance in jargon: You are a human, not a javascript function

Just because someone said API and what you're working with is actually GraphQL shouldn't be a hurdle. They just want to sound nerdy like you and be a part of the scrum or agile or whatever acronymic framework you use for being organized and accountable. Just nod and smile and focus on the big picture as I mentioned in my last section. The alternative solution is just to not use tech jargon with stakeholders. Just say you're doing your thing and they'll accept it. True story: my old co-worker, who is a very accomplished and talented software developer, calls CSS transitions wooshy-woos and I still do it to this day. It's fun and keeps things light. 

## One concept at a time

I used to teach first grade math. When a six year-old does not know what you are talking about they will disengage and become unstimulated. And when a six year-old becomes unstimulated they will find something to stimulate themselves with and you will not like it. Adults will be polite, but the result is the same: they will disengage and will not learn.

I was trained to find areas of confusion in my lesson plans and I always found the areas were when a new concept was introduced. If you're writing documentation on, say [how to build a Jekyll site](https://edcupaioli.com/blog/how-to-create-a-jekyll-site-with-github-pages/), I can't successfully tell people to use a gem install command without first explaining how to install ruby. Assume your audience just started coding yesterday. They said "hello world" and now they want to create something great. You're here to help them along not prove that slapper or whatever "powerful" tool you use is the greatest. They don't care, they want to make the thing. Take them through the steps as if Amelia Bedelia herself following the tutorial. 

## They asked you to help them; help them

If someone does not understand the solution you gave them, they are not stupid. You have simply failed to explain the solution in a way they can understand it. Everyone learns differently. My old boss gave me a PDF of an O'Reilly book, but it didn't work for me. I'm a tertiary learner so I asked for projects that helped me better understand javascript. He gave me the room to grow and learn and it payed off: I now can code javascript without wanting to throw my computer out the window and live life off the grid less than three times a day. As the teacher, it's on you to find the best way to help them not the other way around. If you don't see all the info you need to help them, ask them to provide that specific information, not "I don't know what you're talking about." I get it, sometimes tickets or emails come across as vague or confusing to you, but try to empathize and break down the steps and how you can best help them.
