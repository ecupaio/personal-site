You are part of or lead an organization or business, you have a website, and you just want to be able to edit it periodically and never have to worry about anything else. I get it, many moons ago I was on the other side of the javascript mines. Your website enables you to reach people in multiple ways more efficient than spinning a sign on the side of the road. So why are you worrying about about server fees, core updates, and a myriad of plugins duct-taped together to make your site barely function. It's time to ditch that Wordpress site and embrace the future with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is part of the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) movement to create faster, more secure websites. It's what I made this website with and countless other websites with. It's relatively simple to develop on, free to host, and comes with several options for content management. I've spent 4 years developing an optimized template ready to launch sites in a fraction of the time of any of the LAMP stack sites like Wordpress or Drupal with no hosting fees and no maintenance. My current record for an e-commerce site is 3 days and I was able to create a landing page site in 4 hours once. I should mention here that I like most developers charge hourly.
