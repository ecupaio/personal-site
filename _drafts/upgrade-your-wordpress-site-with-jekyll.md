You are part of or lead an organization or business, you have a website, and you just want to be able to edit it periodically and never have to worry about anything else. I get it, many moons ago I was on the other side of the javascript mines. Your website enables you to reach people in multiple ways more efficient than spinning a sign on the side of the road. So why are you worrying about about server fees, core updates, and a myriad of plugins duct-taped together to make your site barely function. It's time to ditch that Wordpress site and embrace the future with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## What is Jekyll?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is part of the [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) movement to create faster, more secure websites. It's what I made this website with and countless other websites with. It's relatively simple to develop on, free to host, and comes with several options for content management. I've spent 4 years developing an optimized template ready to launch sites in a fraction of the time of any of the LAMP stack sites like Wordpress or Drupal with no hosting fees and no maintenance. My current record for an e-commerce site is 3 days and I was able to create a landing page site in 4 hours once. I should mention here that I like most developers charge hourly.

## Wordpress requires constant updates

Wordpress generates by making pages based on PHP functions making calls to a SQL database which leaves security vulnerabilities that hackers continuously try to exploit. In non-code speak, this means that the very nature of how Wordpress works is never going to be fully secure, so that means you're going to need to keep up with those core updates that your hosting service reminds you about. What's worse is that all of the plugins you have installed are independently maintained so if they don't want to update for the newest Wordpress core version, you're SOL. You have probably seen this image:

The great thing about Jekyll is that it doesn't need updates or plugins to function. It's static which means that all your pages are made server side and un-hackable. No plugins are necessary as I will code the site bespoke to your exact specifications instead of relying on someone else's code that they might forget about.
