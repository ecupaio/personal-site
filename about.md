I'm a techie, organizer,teacher, and dog lover. I enjoy making things on the internet for people to click on, particularly projects with a cause and an end goal in mind. My philosophy for products is that they must be usable by the end-user, otherwise what's the point in making them? In fact, the content you see before you can be managed through an admin interface. For more info about what I've done, take a look at my portfolio and my resum√©.
